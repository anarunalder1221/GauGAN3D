# GauGAN3D
Source code for my GauGAN3D thesis

The MATLAB scripts are configured for the machine used to develop GauGAN3D. These will need to be updated in areas such as files to load in to work in other environments.

The Google Colab notebooks are also configured for use with my personal Google Drive set-up and again will need to be updated to work with other machines.
